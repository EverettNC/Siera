## 🧠 Sierra: The Seer AI

**Sierra** is an adaptive AI system engineered for individuals with **sight, vision, and hearing impairments**. As part of the Christman AI Project's accessibility-first ecosystem, Sierra serves as both a perceptual bridge and a cognitive translator — **a Seer** in the truest sense.

---

## 💡 Purpose
Sierra is designed to:
- Provide **real-time sensory translation** for users who are blind, low vision, or d/Deaf/Hard-of-hearing
- Deliver high-context, emotionally intelligent feedback
- Support independent navigation, interaction, and communication with digital and physical environments
- Empower users with adaptive intelligence that grows alongside their unique needs

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### 🧠 Neural Architecture
- Built on the **Stardust Framework**, Sierra incorporates:
  - Custom optical nerve simulation modules (for visual-to-audio/tactile translation)
  - Soundscape-to-signal parsing for vision-only users
  - Emotion-aware NLP via Derek C’s empathy pipelines

### 🧭 Sensory Translation Engine
- 📷 **Visual Scene Parsing** → Audio + Text + Vibration
- 🔊 **Audio Recognition** → Captions + Emotion cues
- 🖐️ **Tactile UI Interface** → Haptic-coded outputs for silent environments

### 🔐 Accessibility + Privacy
- Local-first mode for sensitive user data
- No always-on mic/camera recording
- Full transparency in data handling and decision logic

## 🏗️ Modules in Development
- `optic_bridge.py` – Parses real-time camera input into audio-tactile feedback
- `soundscape_navigator.py` – Maps ambient sound for low-vision navigation
- `sierra_brain.py` – Core cognition + short/long-term user adaptation
- `a11y_router.py` – Intelligent routing based on user’s selected disability mode
